A MAX for Live reverb, based on a comb and all-pass filter design by Schroeder (a basic description can be found [here](http://write.flossmanuals.net/csound/e-reverberation/)).

The reverb has some additional effects added to make the sound more interesting; nearly all the parameters of the filters can be controlled.

# Reverb description

* Section 1: Chorus section - a chorus-ed signal can be fed into the reverb

* Section 2: Pre-delay section: the signal can then be delayed, a low pass filter can also be applied

* Section 3: Comb filter section (per Schroeder's design)

* Section 4: All-pass filter section (per Schroeder's design)

* Section 5: Pitch shift section - the reverb-ed sound can be pitch-shifted and mixed with the original reverb sound
